Goal: 

Phase1:
Tries to simulate group behaviour while each agent has two "tanks" of food and water that loose some amount of content each tick and cause death of agent if one of them becomes empty. 
Death of the agent gives group penalty.
*Negative personal reward for each tick the level in any of internal tanks is below some level (10%)
There should be at least one reservour of food and water on the map. Physical contact with reservour replanishes corresponding (water/food) internal agent's tank and brings personal reward to the agent.


Phase2:
Enables intercommunication between agents, allowing them to exchange resources. Comminucation ("session") could be establish after physical contact between two agents and requires some "handshake", that been completed prevent both sides from having any other communication (thus only one session is possible at a time for an agent).
